  "summary": "The diff implements a backend migration to rename FoodItem fields (available→isAvailable, preparationTime→prepTime) and updates frontend components to use the new field names. It adds data initialization logic to seed five food items on admin login, enhances ProductsPage with loading/error states, and includes debug logging throughout the query pipeline.",

    {
      "description": "Backend migration module (backend/migration.mo) that migrates old FoodItem schema fields to new schema",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states 'Do not modify the backend migration.mo file unless data structure changes are required' as a constraint. While field renaming (available→isAvailable, preparationTime→prepTime) could be considered a data structure change, the BuildRequest does not request any backend schema changes—it focuses on debugging frontend display issues.",

      "description": "Backend main.mo includes migration logic with '(with migration = Migration.run)' actor syntax",
      "reason": "No requirement requested adding migration execution logic to the backend actor. The BuildRequest constraint mentioned not modifying migration.mo unless necessary, but did not request creating or executing migrations.",
